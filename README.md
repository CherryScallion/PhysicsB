In short, PhysicsB framework transforms EEG data to a signal strength with 64 dimensions, these information would be decoded as fMRI data that has been ICAed, and reverted to full fMRI image via a pt file, instead of caculate full fMRI image directly. Compared to other methods in the area, our method improves accuracy and reduces performance requirements.

This project is still under development.

But of course, current results are not 100% valid, they contain a lot of problems, but still cool enough.

If you find any error or unproperate design, welcome to report.
